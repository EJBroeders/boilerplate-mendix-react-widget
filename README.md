# Mendix React widget boilerplate

This is a base boilerplate for Mendix widget development which includes ES6+
features and NPM packages. This boilerplate includes example code for a Hello
World widget written with React.

When cloning this repository, do not forget to update `package.json` and run
`npm install`. After that you can start working in the `src` directory the same
way as with earlier Mendix widget development. You can start immediately with
ES6+ features and importing any other NPM package. Take a look at the
HelloWorld widget for an example. To transpile and bundle your widget, run `npm
run build`. The resulting `widget.mpk` is copied to the Mendix folder for
further development and testing.

If you have any questions, just ask! I'd love to hear some feedback!
